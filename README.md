# Google Search Automation

This project is a simple Python script that automates Google searches using Selenium WebDriver with Microsoft Edge. The script is designed to perform a series of searches based on specified queries and repetition parameters.

## Features

- Automates searching on Google for specified queries.
- Supports multiple repetitions of each query.
- Waits for the search results to load before proceeding to the next search.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Microsoft Edge WebDriver (compatible with your Edge version)
- Selenium library

### Installing Dependencies

You can install the necessary library using pip:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

## Setup

1. **Download Microsoft Edge WebDriver**: Make sure you have the correct version of the WebDriver that matches your version of Microsoft Edge. Place the WebDriver executable somewhere accessible on your system and update the `driver_path` in the script to point to the WebDriver.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BS-World/Google-Search-Automation.git
cd Google-Search-Automation
```

3. **Modify the Script**: Open the script and modify the `driver_path` variable to point to the location of your `msedgedriver.exe`. You can also customize the search queries and repetition count.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python Automation.py
```

2. The script will open a new Edge browser window and begin performing Google searches based on the defined queries and repetitions.

## Important Notes

- Be cautious with the number of repetitions. A high count may trigger Googleâ€™s anti-bot measures, and your IP may get temporarily blocked.
- Modify the `time.sleep()` value to manage the pacing of the searches based on your needs.
- Ensure that you comply with Google's Terms of Service when using automation tools.
